INVOICE EXTRACTION INSTRUCTIONS:  

1. The overall invoice total should NEVER be assigned as a price to any individual line item.
2. Column headers (like \\\"PART IDENTIFICATION\\\", \\\"Line No\\\", \\\"QTY SHIP\\\", \\\"EXT AMT\\\") are not line item descriptions - don't confuse them with actual product descriptions.
3. Line items without explicit unit prices should have zero values for price fields, not the invoice total.
4. On the final page of multi-page invoices, distinguish between:\n   - The invoice TOTAL (belongs in header.total)\n   - Individual line items (need their own specific prices, if shown only)
5. Line items showing only reference information without explicit pricing should have zero price values.
6. Do not use \\\"Part Identification\\\" as a description - this is a column header, not the actual description.
7. For each line item, verify that the price comes from the appropriate unit price or amount column for that specific item only.
8. Differentiate between actual line items and summary information - summary totals belong in the header, not as line items.
9. Extract the Quantity and Line No for each line item:
	- If a line item spans multiple pages, the quantity may appear on an earlier page, and the line number on a later one — these must be correlated and combined.
	- Some items may not have a line number — in such cases, leave the line number field blank or null.
	- The line number is often found in the 4th line of the item description block — parse accordingly to extract it.
10. Pay special attention to items at page breaks - these may appear to be continued items but are often distinct line items with their own quantities and values.
11. Each distinct part number and quantity combination represents a separate line item. Do not merge similar items.
12. Remember that a line item description starts with an NA number like NA002472 and ends with a line number like Line No: 1.000. A line item might spill over to the next page. But remember that a line item always starts with QTY SHIP.
13. A DAFG type line item would not have an NA number. Usually the DAFG line item is and the end of the line items is always one line item.
14. If the line item in a new page begins with a Line no, then the Line no belongs to the last item of the previous page (due to spill over of the line item).
15. A line number is not continous. It can go from 5.002 to 7.000 to 7.001 to 8.000 to 10.000 as an example.
